= tag_genes.pl = 
find the cutoff len (out put of this file is tags dir, var tag len, vary strain.)

= make_gene_calls.pl =
apply the cutoff len (this works on a summarized blat output...)


other/sample_indiv_type.csv is from Ian. I will extend this file with gene count / sp calling data.

=> merge_top_strain_with_indiv_type_data.pl
does two things: it picks the top counting E coli sp
     	 	 it merges Ians file with this call. 

all_hits.tgz is a list of all of the genes that each contig set contains (from every NCBI sp).

 lists the top 10 scoring E coli's genes found in every contig set

= grouping genes =

we want to build up some sets to find out which genes dominate which individual, and how that changes over time
or how that changes between individual.

step 1) want to make sets like :
tp1.barcode1 {a,b,c}  	  (indiv 1)
tp1.barcode2 {a,b,c}	  (indiv 1)
tp1.barcode3 {a,b,e}	  (indiv 1)
tp1.barcode3 {b,c,d}	  (indiv 2)
tp1.barcode3 {b,c,e}	  (indiv 2)
tp1.barcode3 {b,c,f}	  (indiv 3)

step 2) want to work out the fraction of samples PER INDIVIDUAL every gene occurs.
tp1.indiv1{ a=>3/3=1.0, 
	    b=>3/3,
	    c=>2/3,
	    e=>1/3 }
tp1.indiv2{ b=>1,c=>1,d=>1/2,e=>1/2 }

step 3) get the deltas.
tp1.indiv1{ a=>(1-0)=1, 
	    b=>(1-1)=0,
	    c=>(2/3-1)=-0.33,
	    d=>(0-1/3)=-0.33,
	    e=>(1/3-1/3)=0,
	    f=>(0-1/3)=-1/3 }
