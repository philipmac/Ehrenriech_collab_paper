other/sample_indiv_type.csv is from Ian. I will extend this file with gene count / sp calling data.

=> merge_top_strain_with_indiv_type_data.pl
does two things: it picks the top counting E coli sp
     	 	 it merges Ians file with this call. 

all_hits.tgz is a list of all of the genes that each contig set contains (from every NCBI sp).

 lists the top 10 scoring E coli's genes found in every contig set
